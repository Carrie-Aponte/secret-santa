# Secret Santa App - Data Storage Documentation

## üìÅ How Data Storage Works

### Current Storage Method: localStorage (Browser Storage)

The application currently uses **localStorage** to persist secret santa assignments:

- **Storage Location**: Your browser's localStorage
- **Storage Key**: `'secretSantaState'`
- **Data Format**: JSON object containing the AppState

### What Gets Stored

```typescript
{
  familyMembers: string[];           // All family members
  availableReceivers: string[];      // People who can still be assigned
  assignments: Record<string, string>; // Who has whom: giver -> receiver
  completedAssignments: SantaAssignment[]; // Array of all assignments
}
```

### Storage Persistence

‚úÖ **Data WILL persist when:**
- Closing and reopening the browser tab
- Closing and reopening the browser entirely
- Computer restarts
- Navigating to different pages within the app

‚ùå **Data WILL be lost when:**
- Clearing browser data/cookies
- Using incognito/private browsing mode
- Using a different browser
- Using a different computer/device
- Manually clicking "Reset All Assignments"

### Files That Handle Storage

- **Save**: `/app/assign_santas/page.tsx` - Line ~38-40 (useEffect saves to localStorage)
- **Load**: Both pages load from localStorage on mount
- **Clear**: Reset button in admin controls

### Upgrading to Persistent Database

For true persistence across devices/browsers, you would need:

1. **Firebase/Firestore** (easiest)
2. **Supabase** (PostgreSQL-based)
3. **Custom backend** with database
4. **Vercel KV** or similar cloud storage

### Family Member Configuration

- **File**: `/app/features/santa/constants.ts`
- **Current Members**: Rosa, Alan, Nhic, Camila, Chris, Carrie
- **To Add/Remove**: Edit the `FAMILY_MEMBERS` array in constants.ts

### Privacy Features Implemented

1. **No Spoilers**: Available people list is hidden to prevent spoilers
2. **Name Validation**: Only exact family member names are accepted
3. **Name Reference**: Family list is shown for exact spelling
4. **Status Tracking**: Shows who has completed assignments (names only, not receivers)

## üîß Technical Implementation

The data flow is:
1. User enters assignment ‚Üí State updated ‚Üí Saved to localStorage
2. Page refresh ‚Üí Load from localStorage ‚Üí Restore state
3. Admin reset ‚Üí Clear localStorage ‚Üí Reset to initial state

This ensures a smooth experience while maintaining privacy and preventing accidental spoilers!
